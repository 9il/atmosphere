bootDoc
===================================
[DDoc](http://dlang.org/ddoc.html) theme using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.
*bootDoc* uses JavaScript to extend and improve DDoc's capabilities, such as by adding a module overview tree and
by enabling fully qualified page anchors.

The theme is designed to work with any project by putting all project-specific information in separate configuration
files.

**Please post bugs, enhancement requests and questions on the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/JakobOvrum/bootDoc/issues). Thanks!**

Features
-----------------------------------
 * Easily configurable for any project, designed to work as a git-submodule.
 * Sidebar with a package explorer tree and a tree of the symbols in the current module.
 * Configurable titlebar, with a go-to-symbol form.
 * Fully qualified page anchor names; individual symbols can be linked without conflicting with similarly named symbols in the same module.
 * Neat styling using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Demonstration
-----------------------------------
Phobos documentation using *bootDoc* can be found [here](http://jakobovrum.github.io/bootdoc-phobos/).
Additionally, the [LuaD documentation](https://jakobovrum.github.io/LuaD/) uses *bootDoc*.

Usage with Github Pages
-----------------------------------

 * Create a gh-pages branch to host the generated documentation ([instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually)).
  - For the purposes of this guide, we will assume this is an empty branch in its own repository in a subdirectory of the repository containing the source files. Since we're using a clean slate branch which still depends on the contents of the master branch (or whatever branch you want to
  generate documentation for), two separate repositories are required.
  - For example, if your project repository is in a directory `myproj`, we will assume your gh-pages repository is in `myproj/gh-pages`.
  - The working directory of the following commands is assumed to be this new directory (e.g. `myproj/gh-pages`).
 * Add *bootDoc* as a git-submodule to your gh-pages repository:
   ```
   git submodule add git://github.com/JakobOvrum/bootDoc.git bootDoc
   ```
 * Copy `settings.ddoc` and `modules.ddoc` from `bootDoc` to the current directory:
   ```
   cp bootDoc/settings.ddoc settings.ddoc;
   cp bootDoc/modules.ddoc modules.ddoc;
   ```
 * Edit `settings.ddoc` and `modules.ddoc` to match your project's profile ([see below](#usage-in-general)).
 * Run the generation tool, passing the root location of your sources: `rdmd bootDoc/generate.d ..`.
  - The list of modules is read from `modules.ddoc`. For example, using the above command, if your `modules.ddoc` has one entry `$(MODULE example.example)`, then `example.example.html` will be generated from `../example/example.d` (aka `myproj/example/example.d`).
  - If you have an index file tracked on the gh-pages branch instead of among the sources, pass it to the generation tool using `--extra=index.d`. Any number of extra files can be passed this way.
 * Push your newly generated HTML files.
  - To update the documentation, run the generation tool again.

Usage in General
-----------------------------------
DDoc is configured using the files `bootdoc.ddoc`, `settings.ddoc` and `modules.ddoc`.
The latter two are templates; copy them to your project directory before editing them.
`settings.ddoc` contains general information about your project; its values are
documented [here](https://github.com/JakobOvrum/bootDoc/wiki/settings.ddoc). `modules.ddoc` contains
a candyDoc-style list of all the modules in your project, and is documented
[here](https://github.com/JakobOvrum/bootDoc/wiki/modules.ddoc).

Pages are generated using the included tool `generate.d`. Run it without arguments to
see an overview of how to use it.
